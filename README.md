# Project preview & description
E-commerce project made with PHP Laravel, this project idea has been given me by chatGPT because I wanted to make a beginner/intermediate project to get myself more in touch with this awesome framework. As a side note, this project has so much potential for new features to be added, however, I just feel like I've done everything I can for now. I might add new features to it later on once I gain more experience and confidence on working with bigger projects.

<p>
    You can preview products and lookup for anything that you want in the search bar (this function basically looks for: name, description & categories. if anything matches it brings it to show up). At this example, I searched for word "apple" so I got the apple products back.

<p>
    When you press any product you get transitioned to single product page that gives you details about the product and its owner.

<p>
    Here I made an account to test and add a product.

<p>
    Once logged in successfully, you get two additional options in your navbar. Manage products lets you check the products you own, and cart that lets you add products to it.

<p>
    I tried to add a new product so I got sent at the create product page, like you see down here.

<p>
    Once you save everything, it appears on the main page organized by latest.

<p>
    I pressed manage products so as to see products related to my account. As expected, only the product that I've just added appeared. It gives full authority to the product owner to edit or delete.
</p>

<p>
    If the product owner wishes to edit his already existing product, you got sent here.

<p>
    I went back to the main page and added few products to my cart so as to get them.

<p>
    As you can everything has been added to my cart wit the ability to remove anything as the user wishes. Total is calculated as well, if you wish to checkout.
